					<h1>
						Smuggling You Here <small>Part 10</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						Aggravated felonies include illegal alien smuggling, illegal drug trafficking, illegal drug dealing, and illegal drug manufacture. The problem is that the U.S. courts are so overwhelmed by violent Mexican criminals that the government cannot always prosecute them all.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, to get your due in a U.S. court you have to have perpetrated multiple felonies and very aggravated ones at that. The <q>threshold</q> for getting prosecuted today is someplace around multiple burglaries, multiple robberies, multiple auto thefts or a carjacking. The guidelines for prosecution are secret within the government but it seems that only violence, firearms violations, and drugs get their serious attention. They are really more interested in just getting rid of you.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is still possible &mdash; in many cases &mdash; to avoid harsh prison time. The illegal alien can simply plead guilty and will usually get just two years someplace like the 3,000 bed Reeves County Detention Center which is a federal facility run by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in Pecos, Texas.
					</p>
					<p>
						To hold the bubbling flood of mostly Mexican criminals, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has contracts with as many as 70 prisons and jails just in Texas alone. This illegal alien catastrophe is massive. The United States has, after all, fifty states and Texas &mdash; with its 70 illegal alien prisons &mdash; is but one.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once inside one of these facilities you can twist the system to your advantage by claiming asylum or demanding protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. If you are a Red Chinese Communist female then you might try to claim asylum because your government will not allow you to have more than one child. If it works &hellip; Bingo. You are in.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, the United States of America is a signatory to the United Nations agreement to stop torture and the suffering of peoples everywhere. The problem is that the only countries that abide by the agreement are First World countries and since almost all Third World countries apply what we could consider <q>inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment</q> to essentially all of their citizens we won&rsquo;t send their citizens back there. It does not matter one iota that the activities in those lands have been like that for millennia. So this means that about 94% of the world&rsquo;s population can illegally enter the United States and then not be returned to their native land. The good news is that they actually have to get to a U.S. border first.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Article 3</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>1. No State Party shall expel, return or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>The Last Word</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Once you have been formally removed from the United States you will never come back. You will never be allowed inside the country again. You can never live here legally. If the feds catch you inside the country then you will go to prison again, and quickly, and for a long, long, <i>long</i> time.
