					<h1>
						Being Detained <small>Part 5</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						Because most illegal aliens stick to themselves &mdash; even if they have been in the United States on and off for decades &mdash; they usually have absolutely no real concept of America or even knowledge of the city in which they live. They are not interested in the United States. They have a family back home and they are here only to make money to send home. Further, mentally they are operating under the laws and rules of their home country even though they are here and have been here for decades. Driving without a driving license or running from a traffic accident or petty theft are usually all normal activities in their home country.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Border Patrol Agent may ask to see any proof of citizenship you may possess. The USBP uses various aids in determining whether the documents provided to an Agent by you are real or forgeries. One such aid is M-396 Rev 8/98 <b>A Guide To Selected U.S. Travel ID Documents.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you hand him a false ID and he detects that it is a false ID then you may soon have certain dramatic and quite personal issues to deal with.
					</p>
					<p>
						At some point during your detainment the Border Patrol Agent may take out a plastic card and read you your rights under U.S. law. The federal version of the <q>Miranda Rights</q> list is the I-214 form.
					</p>
					<p>
						The exact wording of the <q>Miranda Rights</q> statement was not specified by the United States Supreme Court and so American law enforcement and federal agencies have all created their own sets of simple statements.
					</p>
					<h4>
						The federal I-214 is offered in English and Spanish.
					</h4>
					<p>
						What they all says is:
					</p>
					<h4>
						1. You have the right to remain silent.
					</h4>
					<h4>
						2. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
					</h4>
					<h4>
						3. You have the right to have an attorney present now and during any future questioning.
					</h4>
					<h4>
						4. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you free of charge.
