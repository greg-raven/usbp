					<h1>
						Los Angeles <small>Part 2</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						The future of any city can be seen in its children. This new Tijuana of the north has a school population which is 75 percent Hispanic and 9 percent Gringo. Of all the children in these schools, 66 percent come from homes where English is not spoken. The Los Angeles city schools have started a huge taxpayer funded building spree thanks to the growth of the Hispanic population with over 750,000 students in the city&rsquo;s schools &mdash; which represents more children in school than in 27 of America&rsquo;s other states (not cities &hellip; <i>states</i>) <i>combined</i>.
						<p>
							The cost of this building spree takes on unimaginable import when we discover that the word <q>brain</q> in any sentence including <q>members of the Los Angles School Board</q> would be an error. If you had a vast pool of toxic gas beneath a potential school building site and which bubbled and oozed really odd &hellip; <i>things</i> &hellip; (and it also had an active earthquake fault under it) would you spend ten years, millions of dollars and then pick that <i>singular spot</i> for a brand new (Belmont Learning Center) school? Maybe if you had <i>half a billion</i> dollars extra to spend / give to a crony for that <i>one</i> school. They did and did. But it gets better. Over 60% of the entire finished school complex was <q>secretly</q> bulldozed flat in 2004. This act was <a href="http://www.fulldisclosure.net/">videotaped</a>.

						</div>
						<p>
							This northern Tijuana&rsquo;s school system was originally designed for Gringos and for another era when a single school accommodated even 5,000 students. New Los Angeles school designs offer schools with an average of only 500 students to allow these children <q>to learn at their own pace.</q> The hidden reality is that race riots are not infrequent between the Black and Hispanic <q>students</q> and it is one thing to arrive with enough police to quell a 500 person riot and quite another to find enough police to quell a 5,000 person riot. Thankfully too, Los Angeles&rsquo; 163 day school year keeps the rioter&rsquo;s window of opportunity short.
						</p>
						<p>
							And then there is the question of what actually comes out of Los Angeles&rsquo; schools. Only about half of the students who enter the school system ever make it to 12th grade. Thanks to the lowering of standards so that some fraction can <q>graduate,</q> the future for the <q>graduates</q> is abysmal. California has instituted an exit exam which notionally suggests that anyone who gets a high school diploma knows something. The test has been constantly simplified in response to lawsuits which complained the test was <q>racist.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							California operates a three tiered <q>college</q> system. There is the real university system which includes UCLA and UC Berkeley, and then there is a second tier system of California State Universities. Lastly, there is the <q>junior college</q> or <q>community college</q> system. About 70% of Los Angeles high school graduates, who have already passed the California exit exam and have actually received a diploma, must take remedial math and English to be accepted even at a local community college.

						<p>
							As Los Angeles becomes ever more <q>diverse</q> the jails fill to the brim and then to overflowing. What makes it all worse is that the ACLU has filed suit to force the jailers to blend / mix / stir well, the prisoners. What this does (obvious to anyone not deranged) is create a critical mass of violence which then bubbles out beneath every cell door in pools of blood. To contain the city&rsquo;s violence, Los Angeles has the largest jail in the world with more than 23,000 prisoners.
						</p>
						<p>
							While about 25% of the population of Mexico avoids and does not speak the language of the Conquistadors &mdash; Spanish &mdash; this seems not to be an impediment to their success in what they call The Land of The Gringo. Because the Mexican people are truly of the Bronze Continent and strive to bring their heritage to all of America&rsquo;s Southwest, there is no reason for them to really even learn English. It is with great relief that we all must agree that America will instead &mdash; and very soon &mdash; learn Spanish.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then too, attaining new language skills can be an issue. Learning a new language can be traumatic. Federal records show that children transitioning from Danish or Dutch to English take about one year. Children transitioning from German to English take about one year. Children transitioning from Spanish to English take about six years. Children transitioning from Hmong to English take more than eight years. These are average times.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, our travelers from the south have their own ideas about their new life in America and this simple plan is set forth in the <i><q>El Plan De Aztlan</q></i> which is available from printed manuscripts and is even thoughtfully provided on the California State University at Riverside Internet website. This taxpayer funded university reminds us all that they are providing a service <q>fostering the <a href="csu-riverside.html"><i><q>Re-Mexicanization of the Southwest.</q></i></a></q> And it gets even better. If <q>we</q> go to that site we find an image of Christ&rsquo;s Last Supper but depicting Chicano Heroes with (maybe) Che Guevara in the seat reserved for Jesus:

<blockquote>
						<p class="text-center">
							<i><q>El Plan De Aztlan</q></i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>In the spirit of a new people that is conscious not only of its proud historical heritage but also of the brutal <q>Gringo</q> invasion of our territories, we, the Chicano inhabitants and civilizers of the northern land of Aztlan from whence came our forefathers, reclaiming the land of their birth and consecrating the determination of our people of the sun, declare that the call of our blood is our power, our responsibility and our inevitable destiny.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>We do not recognize capricious frontiers on the bronze continent.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Brotherhood unites us, and love for our brothers makes us a people whose time has come and who struggles against the foreigner <q>gabacho</q> who exploits our riches and destroys our culture. Before all of our brothers in the bronze continent, we are a nation, we are a union of free pueblos, we are Aztlan.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Nationalism is the key. Nationalism is the common denominator.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Economic control of our lives and our communities can only come about by driving the exploiter out of our communities, our pueblos, and our lands.</i>
						</p>
</blockquote>
						<p>
							We can quickly see the effects of this plan as we embrace such diversity in this City of the Angels, Los Angeles, 130 miles inside the United States.
