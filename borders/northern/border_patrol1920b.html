						Northern Border <small>Part 2</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						A thousand agents cannot possibly watch 4,000 miles of U.S. / Canadian border. What makes it all even worse is that even USBP Agents need to sleep so less than a third of the 1,000 are on duty at any one moment. The real number is secret but a safe guess qould be that fewer than 250 agents are on-duty defending us from the dozens of known terrorist cells operating in Canada.

						Of the 22 USBP Sectors, only seven are considered absolutely critical to a secure America.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can get the book on the right to scare yourself.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Detroit Sector for instance, is responsible for 804 miles of total wilderness between Michigan and Canada. The Detroit Sector is home not just to wilderness but to the city of Detroit which has the largest Muslim population anywhere outside of the Middle East. With a Muslim population exceeding 150,000, Detroit&rsquo;s City Fathers are amending the city noise ordinance so that mosques might use loudspeakers for the call to prayer.
					</p>
					<p>
						According federal records and Chief Patrol Agent Dan Geoghegan, the Detroit Sector doubled its pre-9/11 staff. The number of Border Patrol Agents now standing between Muslim communities with known terrorist cells operating on both sides of the border is 76.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Detroit Sector&rsquo;s agents patrol 806 miles of Great Lakes coastline and use boats, SUVs, and even snowmobiles. Considering shift work, days off, vacations, and sick leave, at any given time there are probably fewer than 10 agents guarding America from the known terrorist cells in Canada who are just waiting for their opportnity to attack.
					</p>
					<p>
						If Montreal resident Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian-born Al-Qaeda operative who was caught by vigilant U.S. border inspectors, had simply walked across the Canadian border through the woods near Detroit, his bombs would have brought untold death and destruction to his planned target, LAX, and possibly killed more people than were killed on 9/11.You can click on the image below and ask your congessman to do something.
