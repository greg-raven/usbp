							He has &hellip;the facts on his side &hellip;and the guts to tell it like it is.
						</p>
						<p>
							Congressman Tom Tancredo will never be president because he keeps telling the truth. Of course the USA is in mortal danger of complete destruction from illegal immigration and <q>diversity</q> but maybe we can hire more police to keep it to a low roar. New York City has 40,000 city and transit police to keep the muggings and murders off the front page but places like Los Angeles aren&rsquo;t so lucky and with over 800 tattooed and well armed street gangs (not gang <i>members</i> &hellip; <i>gangs</i>) it&rsquo;s the place to be today to see where we are headed. The book comes to you through Amazon.com.

							<i>&hellip; A swarming menace called radical Islam &hellip; rings Europe&rsquo;s cities in smoldering Muslim ghettos, provoking everything from so-called honor killings and political assassinations to the Madrid subway bombings and the massacre of school children in Beslan. Worse, the Taliban-like theocracy &hellip; looming inside backward immigrant populations resistant to integration flourishes under the protective wing of Western Europe&rsquo;s America-bashing, multicultural, liberal establishment.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Europe is dead. It may not know it yet, but even a corpse keeps a few cells alive for awhile. As the Muslims march in from the east and build fortresses of conquest within europe&rsquo;s cities, so too are America&rsquo;s cities becoming pockmarked with no-go zones guarded by ultra-violent Hispanic gangs.

						<i>In The Late Great USA, Corsi proves that the benignly-named <q>Security and Prosperity Partnership,</q> created at a meeting between George W. Bush, Stephen Harper and Vincente Fox, is in fact the same kind of regional integration plan that led Europe to form the EU. According to Corsi, the elites in Europe who wanted to create a European nation knew that <q>it would be necessary to conceal from the peoples of Europe just what was being done in their name until the process was so far advanced that it had become irreversible.</q></i>

						With over two million people in prison in this country, body searches of over two million people each and every day in this country, and soon &hellip; a Homeland Security Background Check before you can own (or ride in) a 20 foot long bass boat, why not just open the borders so we all can become <q>one?</q> The book comes to you through Amazon.com. <b>Just click on the image to get the book.</b>

							How about a <b>DVD</b> movie? This one lets you see how America was in about 1955. Intelligent, clean, hardworking people enjoying real music. This is not some <q>Disneyland</q> but <a href="http://www.cortona.com/">Cortona</a> &mdash; a real town in the very romantic part of Italy with people enjoying clean, wholesome, culture. Some parts of this DVD are so heartwarming that grown men cry.

							<i><q>The most beautiful and one of the MUST MUST HAVE DVDs of Andre Rieu and his Johann Strauss Orchestra.</q></i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Here&rsquo;s another <b>DVD</b> movie that shows how America once was. This one is a bit more impressive because you have 10,000 people in the audience having fun without needing 10,000 police to protect them. Very politically incorrect because the audience sings along and even the teenagers are enjoying themselves. The audience of 10,000 stayed until after 2:30 in the morning singing and loving life. In the distance one can see the hill fortress of <a href="http://www.fort-eben-emael.be/">Eben Emael</a> which played such a prominent role in the start of WWII. America&rsquo;s <q>diversity</q> &mdash; the death rattle of spray cans marking up every building&rsquo;s surface &mdash; is definitely American and not seen here.
