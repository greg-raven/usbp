						Gangs spreading in the military

					<p class="lead">
						CBS News talks to the family of a U.S. soldier killed in gang initiation
					</p>
					<p>
						By James Klatell, CBS, July 28, 2007, 1:12 PM
					</p>
					<p>
						U.S. Army Sgt. Juwan Johnson got a hero&rsquo;s welcome while home on leave in June of 2004.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>Not only did I love my son &mdash; but my god &mdash; I liked the man he was becoming,</q> his mother, Stephanie Cockrell, remembers.
					</p>
					<p>
						But that trip home was the last time his family saw him alive.
					</p>
					<p>
						When Johnson died, he wasn&rsquo;t in a war zone, he was in Germany.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>He had finished his term in Iraq,</q> his mother said. <q>I talked to him the day before his death. He said, &lsquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m in the process of discharging out. I&rsquo;ll be out in two weeks&rsquo;.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						On July 3, 2005, Sgt. Johnson went to a park not far from his base in Germany to be initiated into the &lsquo;Gangster Disciples,&rsquo; a notorious Chicago-based street gang. He was beaten by eight other soldiers in a <q>jump-in</q>&mdash;an initiation rite common to many gangs.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>My son never spoke of joining a gang,</q> Cockrell told CBS News correspondent Thalia Assuras.
					</p>
					<p>
						Johnson died that night from his injuries. His son, Juwan Jr., was born five months later.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>I feel like I didn&rsquo;t prepare him enough to deal with this and I should have,</q> his mother said. <q>But how would I have known there were gangs in the military? I could have had that talk with him.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						Evidence of gang culture and gang activity in the military is increasing so much an FBI report calls it <q>a threat to law enforcement and national security.</q> The signs are chilling: Marines in gang attire on Parris Island; paratroopers flashing gang hand signs at a nightclub near Ft. Bragg; infantrymen showing-off gang tattoos at Ft. Hood.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>It&rsquo;s obvious that many of these people do not give up their gang affiliations,</q> said Hunter Glass, a retired police detective in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the home of Ft. Bragg and the 82nd Airborne. He monitors gang activity at the base and across the military.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>If we weren&rsquo;t in the middle of fighting a war, yes, I think the military would have a lot more control over this issue,</q> Glass said. <q>But with a war going on, I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to do.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						Gang activity clues are appearing in Iraq and Afghanistan, too. Gang graffiti is sprayed on blast walls &ndash; even on Humvees. Kilroy &ndash; the doodle made famous by U.S. soldiers in World War II &ndash; is here, but so is the star emblem of the Gangster Disciples.
					</p>
					<p>
						The soldier who took photos if the graffiti told CBS News that he&rsquo;s been warned he&rsquo;s as good as dead if he ever returns to Iraq.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>We represent America &ndash; our demographics are the same &ndash; so the same problems that America contends with we often times contend with,</q> said Colonel Gene Smith of the Army&rsquo;s Office of the Provost Marshal.
					</p>
					<p>
						The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command reported 61 gang investigations and incidents last year, compared to just 9 in 2004. But army officials point out less than 1 percent of all its criminal investigations are gang related.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>We must remember that there are a million people in the army community,</q> Smith said, <q>And these small numbers are not reflective of a tremendous, pervasive, rampant problem.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						The rise in gang activity coincides with the increase in recruits with records. Since 2003, 125,000 recruits with criminal histories have been granted what are known as <q>moral waivers</q> for felonies including robbery and assault.
					</p>
					<p>
						A hidden-camera investigation by CBS Denver station KCNC found one military recruiter was quick to offer the waiver option even when asked, <q>Does it matter that i was in a gang or anything?</q> That is well within military regulations.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>You may have had some gang activity in your past and everything &hellip; OK &hellip; but that in itself does not disqualify &hellip;,</q> the recruiter said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Military regulations disqualify members of hate groups from enlisting, but there is no specific ban on members of street gangs. Sgt. Juwan Johnson&rsquo;s family says such a prohibition is long overdue.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>Just maybe we can save someone else&rsquo;s child &hellip; somebody else&rsquo;s husband &hellip; somebody else&rsquo;s father,</q> his mother said. <q>I would have loved to have seen him with his child, I really would have &mdash; that part is hard, that part is hard.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						This month a military court sentenced two of Juwan Johnson&rsquo;s attackers to prison.
					</p>
					<p>
						Part two of this CBS News investigation looks at police warnings that gangs in the military are branching out to the streets of America.
