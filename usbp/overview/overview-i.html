					<h1>
						USBP Overview <small>Part 9</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						<b>Here&rsquo;s a synopsis of the senator&rsquo;s remarks:</b>
						<p>
							On June 2, 2007, Senator John McCain rolled out his defense of amnesty on his campaign trail in Le Mars, Iowa. Responding to a question about why we must give all illegal aliens amnesty, McCain delivered the following:
							<p>
								<i><q>In case you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, the thousands of people who have been relegated to ghettos have risen up and burned cars in France,</q> McCain said. <q>They&rsquo;ve got huge problems in France. They have tremendous problems. The police can&rsquo;t even go into certain areas in the suburbs of Paris. I don&rsquo;t want that in the suburbs of America.</q></i>
							</p>
							<p>
								<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/july-dec07/immigration_07-06.html">While our federal politicians seek votes from <i>anyone</i> so they can stay in office, America&rsquo;s cities are becoming desperate to stop the rampaging violence. Even isolated cities like Phoenix, Arizona are taking independent action to save themselves. This linked site has text and audio.</a>
								<p>
									The USBP must make do with less than 14,000 men and women for <i>all</i> of our borders. What&rsquo;s worse is that the Border Patrol stands helpless and nearly unarmed to counter the threat.
									<p>
										<a href="mexican-military.html"><b>Even Mexican Army troops now guard drug convoys crossing our border.</b></a>
										<p>
											Today <q>Amnesty</q> is the catch word.
											<p>
												Under the <a href="http://www.sonofthesouth.net/mexican-war/treaty-guadalupe-hidalgo.htm">1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a>, the United States is <i>obligated</i> to secure our border with Mexico. More than 68 years later we still had not lived up to our treaty obligations to secure our border. It was that attack on America in 1916 that caused us to realize our borders were not safe.
												<p>
													It was that attack on America in 1916 that started the political process to form a small band of brothers that remain today The USBP.
													<p>
														Our flag of red, white and blue, with a field of stars, represents a country that has given nearly a million men for its protection. The only men and women who protect our borders &mdash; and thus our very Homeland itself &mdash; and the priceless hopes and dreams of those million men who gave their lives for us &mdash; are the men and women of the USBP.
														<p>
															<i>This</i> &hellip; is their story.
