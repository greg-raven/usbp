						USBP Today <small>Part 2</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						But there are people far worse than Charles Manson. There are people coming across our southern border who have killed 10 or 20 or even 30 people. And not just one or two of these are coming across our southern border. <i>Hundreds</i> of them are coming across.

						While the wanton violence is turning our cities into <a href="/california/los-angeles/index.html">howling wastelands</a>, some polticians &mdash; to get elected &mdash; are eager to garner votes from any source. And they promise free medical care and schooling for all &mdash; if they get enough votes &hellip;

					<p>
						Then we have United States Senators who are terrified our cities will become like those of europe &mdash; ringed by violent illegal aliens burning cars and creating vast wastelands. So we should give all our illegal aliens amnesty.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i><q>In case you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, the thousands of people who have been relegated to ghettos have risen up and burned cars in France,</q> McCain said in 2007. <q>They&rsquo;ve got huge problems in France. They have tremendous problems. The police can&rsquo;t even go into certain areas in the suburbs of Paris. I don&rsquo;t want that in the suburbs of America.</q></i>
					</p>
					<p>
						The problem for us is that it has already happened in America and it is far worse here than in France. There are over 500 illegal alien gangs with over 40,000 gang members in one <a href="/california/los-angeles/index.html">U.S. city alone.</a>

						Some U.S. Congressmen are finally outraged at what is going on along our border. In this clip we see a U.S. Congressman asking the Department of Homeland Security why his district is surrounded by immigration checkpoints yet the illegal aliens are taking over his streets.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tens of thousands of these people came to this country illegally as children and formed parts of the massive gang culture of Los Angeles. After multiple felony arrests they were deported to their native lands in central America. There have been more than 400,000 gang arrests in Los Angeles (yes, at least 400,000). About 50,000 of these convicted violent felons were then deported to their home countries. The gangs now operating in Guatemala and Honduras are larger than those government&rsquo;s <i>armies.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						While Mr. Manson made America&rsquo;s headlines, Mr. Ebert Anibal Rivera is the poster child for America&rsquo;s future. This Honduran gentleman became upset when the president of Honduras increased that country&rsquo;s penalties for murder. Since he may have had a hundred murders to his credit he punished Honduras by taking women and children from a school bus and hacking them to pieces. The school bus massacre reported in this clip is Mr. Rivera&rsquo;s handiwork.

						<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4124133.stm">Twenty eight died in this school bus event.</a> To escape his certain and unpleasant fate in Honduras he then came here. Because the USBP is so under funded and understaffed, Mr. Ebert Anibal Rivera easily slipped into Texas. It was the<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/001587.htm"> Texas Rangers</a> who captured this person &mdash; near Corpus Christi, Texas.
					</p>
					<p>
						There have been more than 50 kidnappings of Americans along the Texas / Mexico border in just the last two years. A few of the Americans have been released.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Invasions of Texas by the Mexican Army are frequent and violent.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Further, the Mexicans &mdash; in military uniforms or not &mdash; show absolutely no respect for women or children.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Even simple American Park Rangers have been shot dead.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						The U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Anthony Garza, has sent multiple Diplomatic Notes to the Government of Mexico.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ambassador Garza has stated: <i><q>Violence in the U.S. / Mexico border region continues to threaten our very way of life &hellip; Drug cartels, aided by corrupt officials, reign unchecked in many (Mexican) towns along our border.</q></i>
