					<h1>
						A Secret Ransom Payment To Mexico&rsquo;s Pancho Villa
					</h1>
					<p class="lead">
						Bancroft Documents Shed Light on Little-Known Chapter in Career of Mexican Revolutionary
					</p>
					<p>
						By Kathleen Scalise, Public Affairs
					</p>
					<p>
						May 5, 1999
					</p>
					<p>
						Documents recently acquired by The Bancroft Library reveal startling new information on the one-time bandit and famed Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa.
					</p>
					<p>
						The records show that at a critical point in Villa&rsquo;s career &mdash; when he had only a few men under his command but was soon to add thousands more to assemble his famous <q>Division of the North</q> &mdash; a hushed-up ransom payment secretly arranged by Wells Fargo Express bankrolled Villa&rsquo;s resurgence.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ransom money <q>helped propel Villa briefly to the pinnacle of power and influence in the Mexican Revolution,</q> said Walter Brem, the Bancroft Library curator who uncovered the information. <q>This is a real find. It&rsquo;s a real smoking gun. It documents an event that historians have treated warily.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						Brem made the discovery recently while reviewing Wells Fargo field office documents added to the collection in 1996, purchased from a United States dealer. The records supplement Berkeley&rsquo;s extensive holdings on the Mexican Revolution, including about 120 letters and telegrams from Villa during the years 1913 to 1923.
					</p>
					<p>
						Francisco <q>Pancho</q> Villa, born Doroteo Arango in 1878, was an important guerrilla leader in the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920). This bloody struggle ended a 30-year dictatorship in Mexico and ultimately established a constitutional republic.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1910, Villa joined Mexican revolutionary Francisco Madero&rsquo;s uprising against the dictator of Mexico, Porfirio D&Igrave;az. Villa earned the rank of colonel while helping to unseat D&Igrave;az and install Madero. Subsequent political turmoil landed Villa in prison in 1912. He escaped and fled to the United States, but returned to Mexico when Madero and Villa&rsquo;s friend, the governor of Chihuahua, were assassinated in 1913.
					</p>
					<p>
						In perhaps the most romantic legend attributed to Villa, he crossed the border to avenge his friend&rsquo;s death and restore the revolutionary cause with a band of only about eight men, but soon recruited thousands more with his charismatic leadership to form his famous Divisi&Ucirc;n del Norte (Division of the North). By 1914, they had won a string of important victories.
					</p>
					<p>
						Legend has it that Villa fueled this war effort in part by looting a rich silver train, but this account was only reported in one semi-historical 1938 book, <q>Memorias de Pancho Villa.</q> The newly discovered Berkeley documents &mdash; more than a dozen internal memos between Wells Fargo &amp; Company Express, S.A., and its Mexican subsidiary &mdash; proves the story true.
					</p>
					<p>
						A letter from the Wells Fargo shipping subsidiary in El Paso details Villa&rsquo;s attack. On April 9, 1913, Villa&rsquo;s rebel band stopped a Mexican Northwestern train in southern Chihuahua. Villa and 25 men boarded the train and made off with 122 bars of silver bullion, then worth nearly $160,000. Customs and military authorities were alerted. Under these conditions in war-torn Mexico, selling the silver would have been nearly impossible, Brem said.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>What happens when a revolutionary knocks over a train and steals a load of silver?</q> said Brem. <q>What is he going to do with the stuff? There were arms, financial and transportation embargoes at the time.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						Villa&rsquo;s solution, the Wells Fargo papers reveal, was to initiate a backroom deal brokered by Wells Fargo subsidiary agents. In exchange for $50,000 dollars cash, paid out in pesos by the mining companies that owned the bullion, Villa agreed to return the silver.
					</p>
					<p>
						The terms of the deal were to be kept <q>strictly confidential,</q> according to a letter from the Wells Fargo subsidiary, Compan&Igrave;a Mexicana de Express, S.A., dated about three weeks after the theft.
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>Do not let any member of the Junta [the loosely allied revolutionary band trying to overthrow the government] or anyone else know of the terms,</q> the letter said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Wells Fargo refused to publicly acknowledge the payment because it did not want to be accused of <q>aiding and abetting</q> enemies of the Mexican &mdash; and later American &mdash; government. Other documents suggest the company feared copycat robberies.
					</p>
					<p>
						As part of the deal, Villa also promised the Wells Fargo subsidiary <q>protection,</q> pledging not to rob <q>cars or offices themselves or allow anyone else to do so.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						A final letter on the theft indicated Villa ultimately returned 93 of the silver bars. He claimed the other 28 were missing, stolen by his men.
					</p>
					<p>
						Villa went on to become governor of the state of Chihuahua and in 1914 entered Mexico City as one of the victorious leaders of the revolution. But Villa&rsquo;s fortunes soon declined. His forces were badly defeated by rival revolutionaries, and Villa returned to guerrilla warfare. Among subsequent deeds, Villa&rsquo;s execution of 16 United States citizens at Santa Isabel, followed by an infamous raid on Columbus, New Mexico, incurred President Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s wrath. The president dispatched an army expedition after Villa, but the outlaw was never captured.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1920 Villa retired to a Chihuahua ranch. He was assassinated three years later.
