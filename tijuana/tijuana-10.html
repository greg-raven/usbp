					<h1>
						Tijuana <small>Part 10</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						For some reason, on the American side of the border the toll-free hotline (877) NO2METH does pay off and more than 800 Mexican traffickers were recently arrested in a single bust.
					</p>
					<p>
						As <q>freedom</q> is brought to Mexico the citizens are becoming confused. In Zocalo Square in Mexico City nearly half a million people have protested The National Violence. People demanded the death penalty for criminals and carried empty caskets and photos of missing or murdered relatives. They shouted Basta! Basta! (Enough! Enough!).
					</p>
					<p>
						The murder rate in Mexico is three times that of the United States and they have no guns (guns are illegal, remember?). Mexico has about the same number of murders a year as the United States (15,000) but they have one third the population.
					</p>
					<p>
						There have also been a little over 15,000 kidnappings in Mexico in recent years. Business leaders in Mexico City even brought in former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and paid him $4.3 million American dollars to stop the crime. He failed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Who perpetrates these murders? Around the world murders are perpetrated by males between the age of 15 and 34. They are not perpetrated by old ladies or infants in prams. Who crosses our border illegally? Mexican males between the age of 15 and 34. Mexico is thus exporting not just their <q>workers</q> but their, and the world&rsquo;s, most violent demographic.
