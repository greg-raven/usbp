					<h1>
						Tijuana
					</h1>
					<p>
						The city of Tijuana is home to about two million souls. The city is comprised of a ring of <q>colonias</q> and a center core. The tourist area is to the west of the Port of Entry along Tijuana&rsquo;s Avenida Revolucion. The town has a bull ring, Jai Lai, and some of the most violent drug cartels on earth.

						The tourist symbol of Tijuana might be the painted donkey.
					</p>
					<p>
						While Tijuana depends almost entirely on the U.S. city of San Diego for its economic existence, Tijuana launches gang members, drugs, and violence over the border with sheer ebullience.
					</p>
					<p>
						There may be a new future for the city because Miguel Angel Badiola, director of public relations for the city of Tijuana is making Tijuana a sister city with Havana, Cuba. The sister city agreement is sponsored by Tijuana&rsquo;s Friends of Cuba and its general coordinator Javier Heredia Talavera.

					<p>
						The image is from Tijuana looking north east into the USA. The Tijuana Silver Arch and the U.S. border&rsquo;s double fence are both visible.
					</p>
					<p>
						In Tijuana, the newspapers are filled nearly every day with stories about <q>Mas Sangre</q> &mdash; More Blood &mdash; the unbridled violence of the local Drug Cartels.
					</p>
					<p>
						The violence is so bad that Tijuana&rsquo;s citizens have held mass protests in public squares and street marches packed with thousands all to call attention to their plight.
					</p>
					<p>
						The violence is so bad that the citizens of Tijuana have created their own <a href="tijuana-armored-cars.html">armored car manufacturing business</a>to protect those who feel they are now or will soon be targets.
					</p>
					<p>
						The popular saying in Tijuana is: <q>Tijuana, so close to America and so far from God.</q> However, Tijuana is Mexico, it is not <i>los Yunaites Estaites</i> &mdash; the <q>Spanglish</q> term for America. The real tragedy is that this story repeats itself in nearly every town along the entire 2,000 mile border.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tijuana is known for its night life and entertainment. American tourist pamphlets on Tijuana say things like <q>It&rsquo;s a place for adventure! Tijuana today can be one of the most exciting cities on earth if you know where to look.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						You really don&rsquo;t have to look very far.
