						Immigrant Impact <small>Part 9</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						The United States of America spent over forty years defending itself against a terrible foe. That foe was the Soviet Union.
					</p>
					<p>
						The United States built 70,000 nuclear weapons of 65 different types to protect ourselves from a Soviet army of two million men. That two million man army was composed of Christians (the govenment leaders were definitely not Christian) who were responsible for fine art, fine music, the first man in space, and rockets to the moon.
					</p>
					<p>
						What makes up an army? An army is made of men between the age of 15 and 35.
					</p>
					<p>
						What comes across our border by the millions each year? Men between the ages of 15 and 35.
					</p>
					<p>
						Afghan drug lords are now teamed with Mexican drug cartels to flood our cities with heroin. In Mexico, this Muslim Connnection to the drug cartels has brought beheadings to the streets of border towns. Many Mexican cities are now surrounded by Mexican Army troops and tanks &mdash; all to quel the violence. The city of Tijuana had its entire 3,000 man police force disarmed and replaced with Mexican Federal Troops.
					</p>
					<p>
						What we have below are two images. One is of an enemy we fought tooth and claw for seventy years nearly bankrupting our country. The other we today invite across our border with welfare, free medical care, and more. The centers of many American cities are now controlled by MS-13 and others of the most violent gangs in America&rsquo;s entire history. These gangs want to kill police and federal agents to rise in reputation among their own kind. Our prisons are now filled with a violent criminal class never seen before anywhere on earth.

					<p>
						In all of the 70 years of the Soviet Union &mdash; including the years of the proxy war of Vietnam &mdash; they killed fewer Americans in total than Mexican Illegal Aliens do inside this country <i><b>in a single year.</b></i>
					</p>
					<p>
						What is our Border Patrol to do when these people invade our country? Run and hide. This is the actual card carried by the USBP which spells out in detail what they are to do when these Mexican gangs or the Mexican Army invade our country:
