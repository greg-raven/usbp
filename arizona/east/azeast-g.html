					<h1>
						East Arizona <small>Part 7</small>
					</h1>
					<p>
						The town of Tombstone has been called <q>The town too tough to die.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						It has that spark of The American Frontiersman even to this day.
					</p>
					<p>
						Back in 1877, Edward Schieffelin began prospecting between the old Fort Huachuca (now a center for Army Intelligence and CIA operations). He wandered about the countryside prospecting. His army buddies suggested that wandering these arid lands would land him a tombstone and not a silver strike. They were right and wrong. He landed a silver strike, named it Tombstone, the town followed with the same name, and he is buried on a nearby hill.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mining towns have never been known for their passivity and Tombstone was a center for lawlessness. President Chester Arthur threatened to declare martial law if the violence wasn&rsquo;t kept in check.
					</p>
					<p>
						The embarrasing reality is that the lawlessness of today&rsquo;s Arizona at the hands of drug smugglers and alien smugglers is actually greater than the lawlessness of Chester Arthur&rsquo;s day but it is ignored.
					</p>
					<p>
						The hardworking people of the Tombstone area supported America in two World Wars by providing America with the manganese and lead. Tombstone was also instrumental in the making of America&rsquo;s atomic bomb in that key machinery used to refine the bomb materials used hundreds of tons of pure silver &mdash; and much of that silver had come from Tombstone, Arizona.
					</p>
					<p>
						The saloons of Tombstone are rich in history &mdash; and bullet holes. Many continue to operate to this day &mdash; although the rich smell of gun smoke remains in the distant romantic past.
